            <h3>Drums</h3>
            <p>Drums have been apart of my life since I was 5 years old. <br> Above is a picture of a drum kit I had 
                custom made by my <br> favorite drum company called "SJC Custom Drums" in 2020.</p>

            <h3>Concerts</h3>
            <p>My first concert was in 2015 at a music festival in Mountain View, California. <br> Since then, I can't 
                even count how many I've been to!</p>
