# Professional-Portfolio

## Description
This is my portfolio showcasing websites I've created to help me get a job after this bootcamp. It's purpose is to show future companies what I can do in web development. I will continue to add to it as I move forward through the bootcamp. So far, I have an about me section followed by future projects. Since we haven't reached any projects, I made a link to a website I worked on by adjusting the code fit better standards.
